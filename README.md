# U-DIT: Unet-like Dilated Transformer for Cardiac MRI Segmentation
###### This repository proposes a new deep learning method based on vision transformer (ViT) to automatically localize and segment left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO) in cardiac MR images. 
## The corresponding code will be uploaded soon
