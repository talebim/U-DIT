# U-DIT
## **Introduction**
This repository contains a new deep learning method based on vision transformer (ViT) to automatically localize and segment left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO) in cardiac MR images. The method is introduced in the following paper:
"[U-Dit: Unet-Like Dilated Transformer for Cardiac MRI Segmentation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4866882)"
